## About
I'm very interested in human misjudgment especially cognitive biases, so I built a simple Go program which fetches a random cognitive bias and displays it on the terminal. 
I think the more familiar is one with cognitive biases the more he is able to avoid them.

## Requirements

Go should be [installed and set up](https://golang.org/doc/install) on your system. 

## Installation

* Prepare the executable 

```shell
$ go get github.com/zuzuleinen/bibi
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/zuzuleinen/bibi/
$ go install
```

## Todo
In the future, I might set it up to send e-mails at a certain interval.
